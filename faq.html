  <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
  <p>Still wondering? Your questions may be answered here</p>
  <div class="section-container">
  <button class="accordion">How often do I need to restring your racquet?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>While it is a subjective question, there is a saying that if you play once a week, you should restring once a year, 
      if you play twice a week, every 6 months, and so forth. For me, I like to restring my racquets after every 10 hours of play or so.</p>
  </div>
  
  <button class="accordion">What are the different types of strings on the market and which one is right for me?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Most players nowadays are using polyester strings, which is best for control and generating spin. These strings are best for intermediate
       to advanced level players as they are quite harsh on the arm and elbow. For beginners, synthetic gut or mulifilament will be best as 
      they are soft, have good power and feel. </p>
  </div>
  
  <button class="accordion">What's the difference between string gauges and how do they affect playability?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Thinner strings can produce more spin, have better feel and more power but they are less durable.
       With thicker strings, you gain more control and more durability, but you won't be able to generate as much spin as thinner strings. 
      If you are string breaker, try using a thicker gauge.</p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion">What is hybrid stringing?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>Hybrid stringing is when you combine two different strings on your racquet to get the best out of both worlds. While polyester is a 
      good string from spin and control, it can make the stringbed feel hard. To combat this, players can combine a softer string such as 
      synthetic gut, multifilament, or natural gut so they can get more touch and feel. </p>
  </div>

  <button class="accordion"> What is string tension and how does tension affect play?</button>
  <div class="panel">
    <p>String tension is how tight you want the strings to be in your racquet. Stringing your strings tighter gives you more control while 
    stringing your strings looser gives you more power. Everyone's tension is different and unique based on their playing style. </p>
